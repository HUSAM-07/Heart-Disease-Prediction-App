# Heart Disease Prediction Application

- This Application is developed using the Streamlit Library in Python

## Libraries Used
* **streamlit**: Build interactive data apps for exploration, analysis, and storytelling. (https://docs.streamlit.io/)
* **numpy**: Powerful array manipulation for numerical computations. Foundation for data analysis and machine learning. (https://numpy.org/)
* **pandas**: High-performance data structures (`DataFrame`) for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. Integrates with NumPy. (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* **scikit-learn**: Comprehensive machine learning library with various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. (https://scikit-learn.org/)

### This Streamlit app allows users to:

- Input health data (age, sex, etc.)
- Uses KNN classifier trained on a dataset (dataset.csv) to predict heart disease presence.
- Provides a binary prediction: high or low probability.
> Note: Emphasize consulting healthcare professionals for medical advice.
